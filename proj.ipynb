For all of you complaining about the market going up during a shit storm, I urge you to recognize that you are going against an entity with unlimited financial ammo. The Fed can add money magically while your pathetic account drowns in a sea of red because you were too stubborn to admit that you were simultaneously both right and wrong. You were right about what the market should be priced at, but wrong about what it's currently priced at because of monetary cocaine.

Soon, though, we're going to break out and follow the arc to start testing lows. In the near term, I'm looking to pick up some 5/8 295c, and maybe 5/15 300c (risky). Cash gang is not a bad place to be right now. If you've got 5/15 puts, I'd look at rolling them out to at least June or July. There's a chance we climb up to a bounce off the 100 MA around 302.
